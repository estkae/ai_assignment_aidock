Taste and adjust seasonings. Set aside.\\n\\nSeason fish with a little salt & pepper on both sides.\\n\\nPlace bok choy, mushrooms, fish, scallions and pour on about ONE QUARTER of the sauce. Top with orange slices, set aside and prepare your second piece of fish the same way.\\n\\nWrap up your parchment by folding the left and right of the paper toward the center, creasing the edges shut as tightly as you can. Next fold and crease the top and bottom edges toward the center. (The first fold will want to fall apart until you get the top and bottom folded).\\n\\nBake for about 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and Let it sit for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Open it and check for done-ness. It should be opaque on the outside and still slightly translucent in the center. If your fish is not all the way cooked, fold the paper shut again and let it sit and steam for another minute or two. (no need to put it back in the oven unless it’s extremely underdone).\\n\\nWhen your fish is done, pour the rest of the sauce over the top and serve.\nName: INSTRUCTIONS, Length: 1009, dtype: object"
